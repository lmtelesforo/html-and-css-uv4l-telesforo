### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
I was refreshed on the workings of CSS and HTML because it has been more than a year when I last coded using HTML and CSS.
I also relearned the syntax and the div logic of HTML.
I also realized that I have to take on more projects to make my portfolio better.
